            <h7>VERA</h7> <p>Devil! Who lured you into the lion's den?</p>  
            
            <h7>CONSPS</h7> <p>Kill him! kill him!</p> <p>Scored through.</p> 
            
            <h7>PRINCE PAUL</h7> <p>En vérité, Messieurs, you are not over-hospitable in your
                welcome.</p> 
            
            <h7>VERA</h7> <p>Welcome! What welcome should we give you but the dagger or the
                noose?</p> 
            
            <h7>PRINCE PAUL</h7> <p>I had no idea, really, that the Nihilists were so
                exclusive. Let me assure you that if I had not always had an _entree_
                to the very best society, and the very worst conspiracies, I could never
                have been Prime Minister in Russia.</p>  
            
            <h7>VERA</h7> <p>The tiger cannot change its nature, nor the snake lose its venom;
                but are you turned a lover of the people?</p> 
            
            <h7>PRINCE PAUL</h7> <p> Mon Dieu, non, Mademoiselle! I would much sooner talk
                scandal in a drawing-room than treason in a cellar. Besides, I hate the
                common mob, who smell of garlic, smoke bad tobacco, get up early, and
                dine off one dish.</p>
