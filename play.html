        <p>PRESIDENT. What hour is it?

            FIRST CONSP. The hour to strike.
            
            PRES. What day?
            
            SECOND CONSP. The day of Marat.[1]
            
            PRES. In what month?
            
            SECOND CONSP. The month of liberty.
            
            PRES. What is our duty?
            
            FOURTH CONSP. To obey.
            
            PRES. Our creed?
            
            FIFTH CONSP. Parbleu, Mons. le President, I never knew you had one.
            
            CONSPS. A spy! A spy! Unmask! Unmask! A spy!
            
            PRES. [2]Let the doors be shut. There are others but Nihilists
            present.[2]
            
            CONSPS. Unmask! Unmask! [3]Kill him! kill him![3] (_Masked CONSPIRATOR
            unmasks._) Prince Paul!
            
            VERA. Devil! Who lured you into the lion's den?
            
            CONSPS. Kill him! kill him![4]
            
            PRINCE PAUL. En vérité, Messieurs, you are not over-hospitable in your
            welcome.
            
            VERA. Welcome! What welcome should we give you but the dagger or the
            noose?
            
            PRINCE PAUL. I had no idea, really, that the Nihilists were so
            exclusive. Let me assure you that if I had not always had an _entree_
            to the very best society, and the very worst conspiracies, I could never
            have been Prime Minister in Russia.
            
            VERA. The tiger cannot change its nature, nor the snake lose its venom;
            but are you turned a lover of the people?
            
            PRINCE PAUL. Mon Dieu, non, Mademoiselle! I would much sooner talk
            scandal in a drawing-room than treason in a cellar. Besides, I hate the
            common mob, who smell of garlic, smoke bad tobacco, get up early, and
            dine off one dish.</p>
